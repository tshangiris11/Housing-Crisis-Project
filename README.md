# Housing-Crisis-Project

Housing affordability is a growing concern in many U.S. counties. Factors such as
increasing rent, low household incomes, and concentrated job or retail development can
displace vulnerable residents who cannot keep pace with rising costs. In this analysis, I
focus on Champaign County, Illinois, creating a “displacement risk” measure by
combining local Census data (rent burden and demographic factors) with variables from the
Location Affordability Index (LAI), such as housing costs, job density, retail density, and
more.
